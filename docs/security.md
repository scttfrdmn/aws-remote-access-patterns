# Security Analysis: Cross-Account Roles vs Access Keys

This document explains why cross-account roles and temporary credentials are significantly more secure than traditional access keys.

## 🔒 Security Comparison Overview

| Security Aspect | Cross-Account Roles | Access Keys |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Credential Lifetime** | ✅ Temporary (1 hour default) | ❌ Permanent (until manually rotated) |
| **Permission Scope** | ✅ Least privilege, resource-specific | ❌ Often over-privileged |
| **Secret Storage** | ✅ No long-lived secrets | ❌ Permanent secrets in databases |
| **Revocation Speed** | ✅ Instant (delete CloudFormation stack) | ❌ Manual, often forgotten |
| **Audit Trail** | ✅ Complete CloudTrail logging | ❌ Limited visibility |
| **Leak Impact** | ✅ Minimal (expires quickly) | ❌ Full account compromise |
| **Rotation Required** | ✅ Automatic | ❌ Manual process, rarely done |

## 🚨 Access Key Security Problems

### 1. Long-Lived Credentials
```bash
# Access keys never expire unless manually rotated
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE      # Valid forever
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY  # Valid forever
```

**Problems:**
- Keys remain valid indefinitely
- Often forgotten in configuration files
- Difficult to track usage and rotate
- Create permanent attack surface

### 2. Over-Privileged Permissions
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow", 
    "Action": "*",     # ❌ Often AdminAccess because IAM is complex
    "Resource": "*"    # ❌ Full access to everything
  }]
}
```

**Problems:**
- Users often grant admin access "to be safe"
- Precise permissions are hard to configure
- Blast radius of compromise is entire AWS account
- No resource-level restrictions

### 3. Secret Sprawl
```yaml
# These secrets end up everywhere:
- Application configuration files
- Environment variables  
- Container images
- Git repositories (accidentally)
- Log files
- Backup systems
- Developer machines
```

**Problems:**
- Secrets stored in multiple locations
- Hard to track where credentials are used
- Accidental exposure in logs/repos
- Difficult to rotate without breaking things

### 4. Manual Rotation
```bash
# Manual rotation process (rarely done):
1. Generate new access keys
2. Update all applications using old keys
3. Test that everything still works
4. Delete old keys
5. Hope you didn't miss any usage
```

**Problems:**
- Manual process that's rarely executed
- Risk of breaking applications
- No automated rotation mechanism
- Keys often remain active long past needed

## ✅ Cross-Account Role Security Benefits

### 1. Temporary Credentials
```go
// Credentials automatically expire
temporaryCreds, err := client.AssumeRole(ctx, customerID)
// These expire in 1 hour by default
// No permanent secrets anywhere
```

**Benefits:**
- All credentials have expiration times
- Automatic refresh mechanism
- Limited blast radius if compromised
- No permanent secrets to manage

### 2. Least Privilege Permissions
```yaml
# Precise, minimal permissions
OngoingPermissions:
  - Sid: "S3DataAccess"
    Effect: "Allow"
    Actions:
      - "s3:GetObject"
      - "s3:PutObject" 
    Resources:
      - "arn:aws:s3:::customer-data-bucket/*"  # Only specific resources
```

**Benefits:**
- Permissions scoped to specific resources
- Separate setup vs ongoing permissions
- Easy to audit and understand
- Follows principle of least privilege

### 3. No Secret Storage
```go
// No secrets stored in your application
type CustomerCredentials struct {
    RoleARN    string  // Not a secret - can be logged
    ExternalID string  // Not reusable without your AWS account
    // No AccessKey or SecretKey stored anywhere!
}
```

**Benefits:**
- No long-lived secrets in databases
- External IDs are not reusable
- Role ARNs are not sensitive information
- Nothing to leak or compromise

### 4. Instant Revocation
```bash
# Customer can revoke access instantly
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name MyService-Integration
# Done! All access immediately revoked
```

**Benefits:**
- One-command revocation by customer
- No coordination required with service provider
- Immediate effect (no propagation delay)
- Customer maintains full control

## 🎯 Real-World Attack Scenarios

### Access Key Compromise Scenario
```
1. Developer commits .env file with access keys to GitHub
2. Keys are discovered by automated scanners
3. Attacker uses keys to access AWS account
4. Keys have AdminAccess (common over-permissioning)
5. Entire AWS account is compromised
6. Keys remain valid until manually rotated (often never)
7. Damage: Complete account takeover
```

### Cross-Account Role Compromise Scenario  
```
1. Temporary credentials are somehow leaked
2. Attacker tries to use credentials
3. Credentials have limited scope (only S3 bucket access)
4. Credentials expire in 1 hour
5. No permanent access gained
6. Customer can revoke access by deleting CloudFormation stack
7. Damage: Limited to specific resources for short time
```

## 🔍 Audit and Compliance Benefits

### CloudTrail Integration
```json
{
  "eventTime": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "eventName": "AssumeRole",
  "userIdentity": {
    "type": "AssumedRole",
    "principalId": "AIDACKCEVSQ6C2EXAMPLE:MyService-acme-corp-1673771400",
    "arn": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/MyService-CrossAccount/MyService-acme-corp-1673771400"
  },
  "sourceIPAddress": "203.0.113.12",
  "resources": [{
    "ARN": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyService-CrossAccount",
    "accountId": "123456789012"
  }]
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Every role assumption logged
- Clear attribution to specific service/customer
- Detailed resource access logging
- Integration with compliance tools

### Permission Boundaries
```yaml
# Built-in permission boundaries
MaxSessionDuration: 3600  # 1 hour maximum
Condition:
  StringEquals:
    "sts:ExternalId": "unique-customer-id"  # Only your service can assume
  IpAddress:
    "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24"       # Optional IP restrictions
```

**Benefits:**
- Session duration limits
- IP address restrictions possible
- MFA requirements supported
- Integration with AWS Organizations SCPs

## 📊 Industry Adoption

Major SaaS providers using cross-account roles:

- **Datadog**: Monitoring and observability
- **Coiled**: Data science platform  
- **Snowflake**: Data warehouse
- **Databricks**: Analytics platform
- **New Relic**: Application monitoring
- **Sumo Logic**: Log analytics

Why they switched:
1. **Better security posture**
2. **Easier customer onboarding**
3. **Compliance requirements**
4. **Reduced support burden**
5. **Customer demand for better security**

## 🛡️ Implementation Security Best Practices

### 1. External ID Generation
```go
// Use cryptographically secure random generation
func generateExternalID(customerID string) string {
    randomBytes := make([]byte, 16)
    if _, err := rand.Read(randomBytes); err != nil {
        // Never use predictable fallbacks in production
        panic("Failed to generate secure external ID")
    }
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s-%s-%s", serviceName, customerID, hex.EncodeToString(randomBytes))
}
```

### 2. Permission Validation
```go
// Always test role assumptions during setup
func (c *Client) CompleteSetup(ctx context.Context, req *SetupCompleteRequest) error {
    // Test that we can actually assume the role
    if err := c.validateRoleAccess(ctx, req.RoleARN, req.ExternalID); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("role validation failed: %w", err)
    }
    // ... store only after validation
}
```

### 3. Credential Caching
```go
// Cache credentials but respect expiration
func (c *Client) AssumeRole(ctx context.Context, customerID string) (aws.Config, error) {
    if cached := c.cache.Get(customerID); cached != nil {
        if time.Now().Before(cached.ExpiresAt.Add(-5*time.Minute)) { // 5min buffer
            return cached.Config, nil
        }
    }
    // ... assume role and cache result
}
```

## 🎓 Migration Guide

### From Access Keys to Cross-Account Roles

1. **Phase 1: Implement cross-account support**
   ```go
   // Add cross-account client alongside existing access key support
   crossAccountClient, _ := crossaccount.New(config)
   ```

2. **Phase 2: Customer migration**
   ```go
   // Support both methods during transition
   if customer.HasCrossAccountRole {
       return crossAccountClient.AssumeRole(ctx, customerID)
   } else {
       return legacyAccessKeyAuth(customer.AccessKey, customer.SecretKey)
   }
   ```

3. **Phase 3: Deprecate access keys**
   ```go
   // Gradually migrate customers and sunset access key support
   if customer.UsingAccessKeys && time.Since(customer.CreatedAt) > 90*24*time.Hour {
       log.Warn("Customer still using deprecated access keys")
       // Send migration reminder
   }
   ```
